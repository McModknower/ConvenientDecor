## New Allert's Umbrella!

Big thank you to Allert for supporting me! ❤️ We worked together on a beautiful new umbrella design for all of you to use!

[Support me on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/mim1q) to get a chance to work with me on your chosen umbrella design! (read the pinned post!)

## Origins Compatibility

Added the highly requested Origins compatibility! Origins affected by rain/sun can now make use of this mod's features:

- Holding any open Umbrella (except the broken one) will protect you from **rain**, **sun** and **sky access**.
- Having a Raincoat with the hood on, or a Rain Hat will protect you from **rain**

## Added new Leaf Pile variants

Before, there were only regular Oak Leaf Piles and the yellow, orange, red and brown variants of it.  
Now, alongside those, there are also Leaf Piles for the following leaf types:

- Spruce
- Birch
- Jungle
- Acacia
- Dark Oak
- Mangrove
- Azalea
- Flowering Azalea
